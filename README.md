# 🏙️ Urban Sentinel
### *AI-Powered Urban Intelligence for Smarter Cities*

> **Preventing urban decay before it happens** — because cities deserve better than reactive fixes.

## 🎯 **The Vision**

Urban blight costs cities **billions annually** in reduced property values, increased crime, and community displacement. Traditional approaches are reactive—we only act after decay has already set in, when it's most expensive to fix.

**Urban Sentinel flips this model.** Our AI system predicts at-risk neighborhoods up to **2 years in advance**, enabling proactive interventions that save communities and millions in taxpayer dollars.

## ✨ **What Makes Us Different**

🔮 **Predictive, Not Reactive** — See the future of your city before it unfolds  
🎯 **94.4% Accuracy** — Trained on 10+ years of real Toronto data  
⚡ **Real-Time Intelligence** — Interactive risk visualization at 30fps  
🗺️ **Actionable Insights** — Click any neighborhood for detailed risk analysis  
💰 **Cost-Saving** — Prevent problems before they become expensive to fix

## 🛠️ **Quick Start**

### **Prerequisites**
- Docker & Docker Compose
- Node.js 16+ (for local development)
- Python 3.9+ (for local development)

### **One-Command Launch**
```bash
# Clone and run the entire stack
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Urban-Sentinel.git
cd Urban-Sentinel
docker-compose up
```

**That's it!** Urban Sentinel will be running at:
- 🌐 Frontend: `http://localhost:3000`
- 🔧 Backend API: `http://localhost:8000`

### **Development Setup**
```bash
# Frontend
cd frontend
npm install
npm start

# Backend
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
python api.py
```
